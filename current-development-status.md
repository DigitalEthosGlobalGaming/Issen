# Current development status

**Asset packing cancelled at the user's request on 7 October 2026.**

The application uses the original source atlases, material maps and asset loaders
again. The packing scripts, generated tight atlases, packed-page stores, UI
texture tokens and packing-specific tests have been removed. Original PBR maps
and generation tooling are restored with the pre-migration material catalog.
Startup preloads and decodes source artwork; material owners load selected maps.
The newer startup lifecycle and rendering refactors are preserved.

The unfinished asset-pipeline performance comparison is cancelled. Saved local
reports remain under ignored `tmp/`; do not restart benchmarks automatically.
The existing performance harness is restored to its pre-packing implementation.

The separate lit-only rendering work remains unintegrated and is not resumed by
this request. Preserve the `codex/lit-rendering-only` worktree and re-audit it only
when the user asks to continue that work. Its former dependency on completing
asset packing no longer applies.

Version **1.66.6** recorded the return to original assets; the current version is
**1.66.7** after the class refactoring below. No push, deployment or release is
part of these requests. Player save keys remain unchanged.

## Verification of the rollback

- Original blob hashes and removal of packing additions verified for 770 paths.
- All 248 unit tests and all 12 focused asset browser tests passed.
- Strict TypeScript and the production verification build passed; all four
  production browser tests passed after connecting scene-surface initialization.
- The broader browser run exposed startup timeouts and a tutorial failure and
  was stopped after the drawing-context fix made that run stale. All five cases
  in the focused recheck passed with one worker, using their original timeouts.
  Do not describe the full browser regression suite as passing.

Verification logs are saved under ignored `tmp/asset-packing-removal/`.

## Class refactoring follow-up

The started `MainGame` and `SceneSurface` class conversions are complete in
version **1.66.7**. Other modules retain their existing
structure. `main.ts` now creates the startup owner from `main-game.ts`; that class
shares overlapping starts and owns partially initialized surfaces, failure retry
and cleanup. `SceneSurface` owns shared initialization, Canvas fallback, bound
disposal and cancellable auxiliary recovery. Tutorial and preview consumers use
that class. Main-canvas combat suspension and input rebinding remain in the runtime.

Strict TypeScript, all 248 unit tests and all four production browser cases passed.
All 241 browser cases passed across the broad run and focused rechecks, including
six new class lifecycle cases. Existing tests now wait for completed startup and
allow enough total time for repeated original-asset reloads; gameplay assertions
and recovery deadlines remain unchanged. The first broad run stopped after eight
startup-wait failures, and rechecks completed the unrun and interrupted cases.
The coverage audit confirms that every case in the 241-case manifest has a passing
result; this is not a claim that one uninterrupted full-suite invocation passed.
Logs and the coverage audit are saved under ignored `tmp/class-refactoring/`.
No benchmarks, lit-only
integration, push or deployment are part of this follow-up.
